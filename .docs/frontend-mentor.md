### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello 👋👋👋

Thanks to fronendmentor team, this challenge gave me an opportunity to learn more about accessibility when building custom component and it is fun! 😁😁😁

🚀 **Built with**

- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- ARIA APG Guides

🐲 **What i have done**

- Built an accessible bar chart component with **keyboard support** using ARIA APG patterns, tested on desktop with NDVA, there will be an instruction for the first time navigating the bar chart.
- Used my own judgement to achieve **pixel-perfect** without design files.
- Overridden default focus outline visual (you can focus on each bar in the chart).

🐦 **Things to improve next time**

- Figure out a system to handle CSS `font` custom variables accross all components.
